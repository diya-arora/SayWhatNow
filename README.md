A cross platform all in one translator app

Motivation
----------
There is no app where many translators are integrated. 
Sure you can use google translate app, the pons app or the 
linguee app. However, you will need to install many apps on your phone.
But what if you want to use only one app, where
all these translators are integrated and you can switch between
them to get different translations?
